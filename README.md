# Nodejs-MongoDB-TodoList-Application

It's one thing staying curious, while it is another engaging curiously.
As a newbie and Nodejs backend software developement enthusiast, i built this application to test my little understanding on the use of nodejs-express.
Also, i made use of MongoDB Atlas for my database hosting.

So, i guess you know that To-Do List Application is a common application that tends to assist its users with outlining and structuring their day-to-day plans/events.
Basically, i used JavaScript/Nodejs technology because of its compatibility with building such applications as this.
I also used MongoDB due to the type of data the application would be interacting with from the users.

I'm hoping that this test garns enough contributions for superb improvement. Feel free to throw in your criticism and other suggestions.

Thank you.
